ONKI Light, version 0.3

Controlled vocabularies are used by indexers describing documents and
searchers looking for suitable keywords. ONKI Light is a web-based tool
providing vocabulary services, such as concept lookup via term searches and
hierarchical browsing. Vocabularies are accessed via SPARQL endpoints
containing SKOS vocabularies.
