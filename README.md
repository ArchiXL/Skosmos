Skosmos
=======

Skosmos is a web-based tool providing services for accessing controlled
vocabularies, which are used by indexers describing documents and searchers
looking for suitable keywords.  Vocabularies are accessed via SPARQL
endpoints containing SKOS vocabularies.

In addition to a modern web user interface for humans, Skosmos provides a
REST-style API and Linked Data access to the underlying vocabulary data.

Skosmos is used as a basis for the Finto vocabulary service. The latest
development version is also available at dev.finto.fi.

Skosmos is implemented using PHP, with Twig templates and e.g. jQuery and
jsTree used to build the web interface, and EasyRdf for SPARQL and RDF data
access.

The code is open source under the MIT license. See Installation in the wiki
for details on obtaining the source and running your own instance of 
Skosmos.

For information about current and future versions, see ReleaseNotes and
Roadmap.

Skosmos was formerly known as ONKI Light.
