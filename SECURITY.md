## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for improving the security of Skosmos. We value your findings, and we'd be grateful if you report any concerns or vulnerabilities directly to `finto-posti@helsinki.fi`.

If the security vulnerability is in a third-party software library, please report it also to the team maintaining it.

Each security concern will be assigned to a handler from our team, who will contact you if there's a need for additional information. We confirm the problem and keep you informed of the fix.
